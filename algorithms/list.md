Sorting algorithms (both comparison sorting and non-comparison sorting)
Tree traversals (just memorize all of these inorder, preorder, postorder, level order)
Traversals - Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS (know the difference between DFS and BFS when would you use one over the other and why - hint, is usually matters when you don't have to search the whole space. Also make sure that you can code recursively and using your own stack/queue)
All the prefix-tree searches

Know all of the Big-O for this and how it's derived.
Most of these questions should be solvable in ~10-15 minutes, some will be more like 20-25. Time yourself.
